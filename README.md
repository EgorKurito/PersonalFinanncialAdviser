In its classical version, personal finance analytics service represents
a retrospective: the user can view the history of their expenses,
grouped by category, and draw their own conclusions.
But it takes time and effort for user to do such analysis, as well as repeatedly return to this exercise.
As a result, as statistics show, not everyone is willing to practice
the analysis of their spendings with a certain frequency.
We thought, why not help users to change their financial habits?
We have everything(/"all data") to suggest, what steps can be taken to
make their spending schedule balanced. And we can
do it with a high precision using data analysis technologies.
It is essentially a digital assistant that will suggest, which buttons to press and
what not to forget. The processing of large amounts of information with mathematical
algorithms will allow user to search for and identify patterns, on the basis of which THE BANK could build a
predictive hypothesis about the most likely behavior to happen in the certain situations. WITH THEIR CLIENT Relying on
such hypotheses, our service can formulate specific advice or general
recommendations for the user. For example, not all customers purchase insurance before travelling abroad.
For those, who do not know, or have forgotten about this possibility, our service could formulate a
helpful advice.

Accordingly, the data from one user group helps to
suggest, what may be interesting to others clients.
The helpful tips our service gives clients are interactive in many ways:
"Stories" on the main screen, thematic widgets in the corresponding sections
and in the smart assistant chat, both in the form of text and
voice messages.
Example: data analysis algorithms allow to capture the spike in mortgage demand. With a high speed of data processing, we can pick
the right moment, when the digital assistant should advise users the offers from a developer partner. Sometimes, such suggestions might face
an additional demand from the user, who considers purchasing real estate after
the evaluation of the relevant offer.
